A MERN stack app with Material UI, with a user and posts database. Mostly made so I could learn how a backend API and authentication are structured. The technologies used are
<ul><li>HTML</li><li>CSS</li><li>React</li><li>NodeJS</li><li>Express</li><li>MongoDB</li><li>MaterialUI</li></ul>.

I knew next to nothing about creating a backend, so the bulk of my time was spent researching that. It uses jsonwebtoken and connects to a MongoDB database. After learning about and
creating API endpoints, routes and authentication, I consumed the API with a very simple frontend using MaterialUI, then tested for bugs and added extra authorization for creating and deleting posts.
